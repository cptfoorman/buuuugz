hi so the main stuff for navigation are the NPCnav component located in 
components/scenes
and then enemies are located in enemies/scenes

i dont really comment my code in editor as i prefer to keep notes outside of it,
so i can work on it while not at my pc,
but i wrote whatever i had on enemies and navigation

hope this aint so bad last guy almost had an aneurism while going over my code
but granted at that point i tried using the observer pattern for the first time
so it was ugly and didnt work

ty so much for trying to help i really appreaciate it, if you need anything just ask
i know im a noob (only a year doing this solo learning) 
but i at least will give it one hell of a try
